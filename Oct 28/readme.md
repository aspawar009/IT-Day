Today i'm working on HTML, CSS & js PROJECT.
In this project I've tried to create a quiz platform to conduct multiple quize.
In this platform we will have multiple quize for each quiz we will have different questions based on quize topics.
In each quiz for each question will have timer at the end of the quiz we will get the result and summary. each quiz we can attend many time usig restart and every time questions will be shuffled.
